## Smart Switch for Electric Geyser
### Overview:
The Smart Geyser Switch project aims to revolutionize the way users interact with their electric geysers by incorporating IoT technology and advanced control features. This innovative switch is designed to provide users with remote control capabilities, real-time status monitoring, and the convenience of setting timers through a smartphone or laptop. The switch is built on a custom-made 4-layer PCB board, integrating a relay, Hi-Link 5V power supply, ESP8266 module, and an OLED display.

### Key Features:

#### IoT Connectivity:
The switch utilizes the Blynk cloud IoT platform, enabling users to control their electric geyser remotely through a smartphone or laptop.
Real-time status updates ensure users stay informed about the geyser's current state, whether it's on, off, or in timer mode.

#### Custom PCB Design:
The switch is embedded on a high-quality, custom-made 4-layer PCB board, ensuring durability, compactness, and efficient performance.

#### Relay Integration:
A reliable relay is integrated into the switch to facilitate seamless control of the electric geyser. The relay allows for on/off functionality, providing users with complete control over the geyser's power supply.

#### Hi-Link 5V Power Supply:
The Hi-Link 5V power supply ensures a stable and efficient power source for the switch, enhancing its overall performance and reliability.

#### ESP8266 Module:
The ESP8266 module is the heart of the switch, enabling Wi-Fi connectivity and communication with the Blynk cloud platform. It ensures a robust and responsive connection between the switch and the user's smartphone or laptop.

#### OLED Display:
An OLED display is integrated into the switch, providing a user-friendly interface for local monitoring and configuration. Users can view relevant information such as current status, temperature, and timer settings directly on the switch.

#### Timer Functionality:
Users can easily set timers for the electric geyser using their smartphone. This feature adds flexibility and energy efficiency by allowing users to schedule geyser operations based on their specific needs.

### Benefits:

Enhanced convenience through remote control via the Blynk app.
Real-time monitoring for increased awareness of geyser status.
Energy efficiency and cost savings through timer functionality.
Custom PCB design ensures reliability and longevity.
